Slimy Skirmish is one of the first games I created as a fun way to learn more about java. 
I worked on it for a month when I was 16 and it came out pretty well. 
It is unfinished however it may be continued and polished at some point in the future.

HOW TO PLAY:
- Download all the files
- Open the "main" file
- Open and run "Main.java" within main
